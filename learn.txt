DevClub at IIT Delhi is a club focussed on increasing awareness
and ability related to technology in and outside the campus.
It is commited towards developing projects by immersing every possible individual
for the benefit of others.
It provides resources, guidance and tech to help every enthusiast to learn about
technological advances.
I have always wanted to learn new things in development and I hope and I'm eager to be a part of it.
